# Metric Chess

Hey there! Welcome to Metric Chess. This is a super fun game you can play with a friend or family member. It's like regular chess but with some cool changes to make it even more exciting—like a bigger board and a new jumping piece! Imagine you're a general leading an army on a big battlefield. Your goal is to capture the other player's king without letting yours get captured. Don't worry if you've never played chess before—I'll explain everything step by step in a way that's easy to understand. We'll pretend we're chatting like buddies, and I'll use simple words. Let's dive in!

What Is Metric Chess All About?
Metric Chess is a game for two players. One player uses the white pieces, and the other uses the black pieces. You take turns moving your pieces on a big square board. White always gets to go first—that's just the rule to make it fair. The whole point is to be smart and tricky, trying to attack your opponent's king while protecting your own. If you put their king in danger where it can't escape, you win! But if neither of you can win, or if things get stuck, it might end in a tie, which we call a draw.

Sometimes games end because one player says, "I give up!"—that's called resigning. Or, if you both agree it's a draw, you can shake hands and call it even. No timers or clocks here since we're playing casually, just for fun. And don't worry about accidentally touching a piece—you can touch them as much as you want without having to move them. It's all relaxed!

The Battlefield: The Board
Picture a big grid like a checkerboard, but bigger—it's 10 squares wide and 10 squares tall, so 100 squares in total! The squares alternate colors, like light and dark, to make it easier to see. But if you don't have colors, that's okay; you can just imagine it or draw lines.

We name the squares to help talk about them. The vertical columns are called "files" and are labeled with letters from a to j, starting from the left if you're playing white. The horizontal rows are called "ranks" and are numbered from 1 to 10, with 1 at the bottom (white's side) and 10 at the top (black's side). So, a square might be called "e5," which means the e file (fifth column) and rank 5 (fifth row up).

White sets up on the bottom (ranks 1 and 2), and black on the top (ranks 9 and 10). The board is square, so it doesn't matter which way you turn it, as long as white is at the bottom.

Your Army: The Pieces
Each player starts with 22 pieces. That's a lot, right? You have different types, each with special powers for moving and capturing. Capturing means landing on an enemy's piece and taking it off the board forever—kind of like tagging them out. You can't capture your own pieces, though! Most pieces can move in any direction, but pawns are special and can only go forward.

Let's meet each piece one by one:

- The King: This is your most important guy—the boss! He looks like a tall piece with a cross on top. He can move just one square at a time, in any direction: up, down, left, right, or diagonal (like a corner). But he can't move to a square where he'd be in danger—that's called "check," and we'll talk more about that later. If your king gets captured, you lose, so protect him like he's your best friend!

  Example: If your king is on f1, he could move to e1, g1, f2, e2, g2, e0 (wait, no—there's no rank 0! He can't go off the board). Or diagonally to e2 or g2. See? Short steps only.

- The Queen: She's the strongest piece, like a superhero. She can move as far as she wants in a straight line: up, down, left, right, or diagonal. But she can't jump over other pieces—if something's in the way, she has to stop before it or capture it if it's an enemy.

  Example: If the queen is on e5 and the path is clear, she could zoom all the way to e10 (up) or a5 (left). If there's an enemy on c5, she could capture it by going to c5.

- The Rooks: You have two of these, like tall towers. They move as far as they want, but only up, down, left, or right—no diagonals. They can't jump over pieces either.

  Example: A rook on b1 could go all the way to b10 if nothing's blocking. Or to j1 across the row.

- The Bishops: Two of these, pointy-topped like hats. They move as far as they want, but only diagonally. They stay on the same color squares forever if the board is colored. Can't jump.

  Example: Bishop on d1 could go to e2, f3, g4, h5, i6, j7—or backward, but no off the board!

- The Knights: Two knights, looking like horses. They move in a funny L-shape: two squares in one direction and then one square sideways, or one square in one direction and two sideways. The cool part? They can jump over other pieces, even your own!

  Example: Knight on c1 could jump to a2 (one up, two left), b3 (two up, one left), d3 (two up, one right), e2 (one up, two right), or even down if possible like b-1—no, can't go off!

- The Trebuchets: These are new and awesome—two per player! Think of them as catapult machines. They can jump over pieces like knights, but their move is different. From where they stand, they can't go to the squares right next to them (like where a king could go). Instead, they go to the outer ring around that—exactly two steps away in any mix of up/down/left/right/diagonal. That means up to 16 possible spots!

  To picture it: If a trebuchet is on e5, it could go to c3 (two left, two down), c4 (two left, one down), c6 (two left, one up), c7 (two left, two up), d3 (one left, two down), d7 (one left, two up), e3 (straight two down), e7 (straight two up), f3 (one right, two down), f7 (one right, two up), g3 (two right, two down), g4 (two right, one down), g6 (two right, one up), g7 (two right, two up). It's like a big square or diamond ring around them, skipping the close spots.

  Example: From a1 (corner), it might only have fewer spots because of the edge, like b3 (one right, two up), c2 (two right, one up). Can't go off, so only valid ones.

- The Pawns: You have 10 of these little soldiers in a row. They're the front line. Pawns only move forward (white goes up toward rank 10, black down toward rank 1). They can always move one or two squares forward if the path is clear—no jumping, and they can't go backward.

  To capture, they do it diagonally forward, just one square. So, they attack differently than they move.

  Example: White pawn on e2 could move to e3 or e4. If there's a black piece on d3 or f3, it could capture to d3 or f3. But if something's straight ahead on e3, it can't move there at all.

Setting Up the Game
Grab your board and pieces. Put the board between you and your opponent, with a white square in the bottom-right corner if it's colored (but not a big deal if not).

For white (bottom side):
- On rank 1 (back row): Trebuchet on a1, rook on b1, knight on c1, bishop on d1, queen on e1, king on f1, bishop on g1, knight on h1, rook on i1, trebuchet on j1.
- On rank 2: Pawns all across a2 to j2.

Black copies this but flipped: On rank 10 (trebuchet a10, rook b10, knight c10, bishop d10, queen e10, king f10, bishop g10, knight h10, rook i10, trebuchet j10), and pawns on rank 9 (a9 to j9).

Make sure the queens are facing each other on the e file, and kings on the f file.

How to Play: Moving and Capturing
You take turns: White first, then black, and so on. On your turn, pick one of your pieces and move it to a new square following its rules. You can capture an enemy piece by landing on its square—poof, it's gone! But you don't have to capture if you don't want to.

Pieces can't go through each other (except knights and trebuchets, who jump). Can't land on your own pieces. And nothing goes off the board.

If you move a piece and it puts the opponent's king in danger, you say "Check!" out loud. That means their king is attacked and could be captured next turn. They have to fix it on their turn: Move the king away, capture your attacking piece with something else, or block the attack if it's from a queen, rook, or bishop (by putting a piece in the way).

Example of Check: Suppose white's queen is on e5, and black's king is on e10 with nothing in between. The queen attacks from e5, so the king is in check. Black must move the king to, say, d10 or f10, or capture the queen if possible.

Special Moves to Know
- Castling: This is a team move with your king and one rook. It's like the king hides behind the rook for safety. You can do it once per game if: The king and that rook haven't moved yet, nothing's between them, the king isn't in check, and the path isn't attacked.

  For white kingside (right side): King jumps from f1 to h1, rook from i1 to g1.
  Queenside (left): King to c1, rook from b1 to d1.

  Black does the same but on their side: Kingside king f10 to h10, rook i10 to g10; queenside f10 to c10, b10 to d10.

  It's one move, and it helps protect the king early.

- Pawn Promotion: When a pawn gets all the way to the other side (white to rank 10, black to rank 1), it turns into something better! You choose: queen, rook, bishop, knight, or even a trebuchet. Not a king or another pawn. It happens right away, even if it captures to get there.

  Example: White pawn on e9 moves to e10—boom, pick a queen! Now you have an extra strong piece.

How Games End: Winning, Losing, or Tying
The game ends in a few ways:

- Checkmate: This is the main way to win. It's when the king is in check, and there's no way to fix it—no safe move, no capture, no block. The player who did the check wins!

  Example: Black's king is on a10, cornered. White's rook on a5 attacks it (check!). King can't move anywhere safe because other white pieces attack those spots. No block possible. Checkmate—white wins!

- Stalemate: If it's your turn, your king isn't in check, but you have no legal moves left (all pieces are stuck), it's a draw. No winner.

  Example: Your king is safe, but all your other pieces are blocked or captured, and the king can't move without going into check. Game over, tie!

- Draw by Repetition: If the exact same board position happens three times with the same player to move, you can call a draw.

- Ten-Move No-Capture Rule: If 10 full moves (that's white's turn plus black's turn = 20 half-moves total) go by with no pieces captured at all (no removals), then count all pieces left on the board (kings, queens, everything—even pawns count the same). The player with the FEWER pieces wins! If you both have the same number, it's a true draw. (Pro tip: If you've trapped their lone king with your huge army, you lose this one—clever defense wins!) Keep track with a pencil or counter if needed.

- Not Enough Pieces: If both sides don't have enough strong pieces to checkmate (like just kings left), it's a draw.

- Resigning or Agreeing: If you're losing bad, you can say "I resign" and the other wins. Or both say "Draw?" and end it.

Tips for Fun Play
Start simple: Move pawns to open paths, get your strong pieces out, and always watch your king. Practice with a friend—laugh if you make mistakes! If something's unclear, just agree on it before playing. Metric Chess is bigger than regular chess (10x10!), so games might take longer, but that's more adventure with extra space to maneuver!

Strategy Guide: Becoming a Metric Chess Master
Now that you know how to move, let's talk about how to WIN! Strategies are like secret tricks to outsmart your opponent. We'll start with tips for each piece alone (tuned for our big 10x10 board), then cool ways to team them up. The extra files (a-j) mean more room on the wings for trebuchets and knights to jump around!

Piece-by-Piece Strategies
- King: Early game, keep him safe in the corner and castle quick to tuck him away (to c1/h1). Don't move him much at first. In the middle or end, sneak him toward the center (like e5 or f5) to help attack or guard pawns. He's slow, so use him like a bodyguard for your last pawns.
  
- Queen: She's a beast, but don't send her out too early—she might get chased or trapped. Get your pawns and knights out first to protect her. Put her in the center (d5, e5, f5, g5) to control tons of squares on the big board. Late game, she hunts lone kings like a shark!

- Rooks: Love open files! Push pawns to clear a file (like the b or i file where they start, or center ones like e/f), then slide your rook up and down it like a highway. Team two rooks on the 9th rank (for white) to gobble pawns. On 10x10, they're great for checkmate from far away across long files.

- Bishops: Aim for long diagonals across the big board—like from a1 to j10. Trade bad bishops (stuck behind pawns) for knights if needed. Pair them with a pawn push to open diagonals. They're lasers for slicing through enemy lines, especially with more diagonal space.

- Knights: Jump to "outposts" like d6, e6, or f6 (holes in enemy pawns they can't kick out easily). Knights fork (attack two things at once) super well—place them where they hit a queen and rook. On a big board, they control the middle best and hop over pawn chains.

- Trebuchets: These jumpy catapults shine in crowded Metric Chess games! Use them to snipe from afar, hitting the "ring" around key spots. Put them on the wings (a or j files where they start) early to control the edges, or central to zap knights/bishops. They're fork machines too—attack two pieces without getting close. Watch out: They skip close squares, so pair with pawns for defense. Extra board space lets them leap farther without edges blocking as quick.

- Pawns: Push the center ones (c, d, e, f, g pawns) two squares first to grab space on the wider board. Make "passed pawns" (no enemy pawns blocking their file) and race them to promote—10 pawns mean more promotion chances! Don't let them get doubled (two on same file)—that's weak. Pawn walls block bishops!

Team-Up Strategies (Combo Powers!)
These are when pieces work together—like superheroes teaming up. I'll explain each one more, how to set it up on the big board, and what it feels like. Start practicing the easy ones like forks!

- Forks: One piece attacks two (or more) enemies at once. Knights and trebuchets are fork kings because they jump—perfect for Metric Chess crowds! How to set it up: Move your jumper to a spot where its L or ring hits two valuable enemy pieces (like queen + rook). Central spots like e5 give the most options. Example: Trebuchet on f5 forks black's queen on g7 and rook on e7. Opponent saves only one—you grab the other free!

- Pins: Trap an enemy piece so it can't move without exposing something valuable (like king or queen) behind it. Bishops, rooks, and queens pin best along lines/diagonals. How to set it up: Line up your attacker so the enemy piece is between it and their VIP—clear paths with pawn trades first. On 10x10, long files/diagonals make pins deadly. Example: Your rook on b5 pins black's knight on b7 (their queen on b9 behind). Knight can't move or queen gets hit!

- Skewers: Like a reverse pin—the valuable piece is in front, weak one behind. Attack the VIP; it has to scoot, exposing the weakling. Rooks/queens on files shine here. How to set it up: Get your attacker on an open line with enemy VIP first, then junk behind. Push pawns to open files like b or i. Example: Queen on e2 attacks black rook on e8 (king on e10 behind)—rook moves, next you take the rook!

- X-Ray Attacks: See "through" pieces like an X-ray—your rook/queen/bishop attacks beyond your own or enemy pawns. How to set it up: Position behind your pawn wall on a file/diagonal; it "sees" through. Great mid-game after pawn trades. Example: Your rook on e2, your pawn e4, enemy knight e7—rook X-rays and attacks knight!

- Discovered Attacks: Move one piece to "uncover" a hidden attack from another—like pulling a curtain. How to set it up: Line up a battery (queen behind bishop), move front piece to reveal boom! Knights work great for surprise checks. Example: Bishop on e4 blocks your queen on e2 attacking king—move bishop to d5, queen check!

- Corridors (File Control): Own a whole file with rooks or queen to invade. How to set it up: Trade pawns on a key file (e or f center), double rooks there, push to enemy back rank. Metric 10x10 gives longer corridors! Example: Two rooks on open i-file roll down to i9, eating pawns.

The Big Board Bonus: With 10 files, control center files (c-g) first. Trebuchets + knights jump over pawn walls to hit back row early!

Defensive Strategies: Spot and Stop Enemy Tricks!
Defense is half the game—like being a superhero shield! Learn to spot when an attack is brewing (early warning signs), then smash it when it hits. Use your checklist to check for these every turn. We'll cover the same combos from offense, but now you're the defender on the big 10x10 board.

- Against Forks: Warning signs: Enemy knight or trebuchet jumping toward your center (d5-g5) or where your queen/rook hang out together. Their piece eyes two of yours? Danger! When it lands: Save your most valuable piece first (queen over rook). If the forker is unprotected (hanging), capture it back with something safe. Move one piece to a spot that attacks their forker. Don't move both—lose one, win the trade!

- Against Pins: Warning signs: Enemy rook/bishop/queen lining up on your file/diagonal, with your piece between them and their target (your king?). Paths clearing via pawn trades? Get ready! When pinned: If it's a cheap piece (pawn/knight), sacrifice it to break the line. Capture the pinner with king or rook if safe (check your king can't be taken after). Advance a pawn to block the line. Absolute pins (to king) can't be broken by moving the pinned piece—illegal! Move the king or VIP instead.

- Against Skewers: Warning signs: Enemy slider (rook/queen) aiming at your strong piece on an open file, with junk behind it. Long 10x10 files make this sneaky! When it hits: If your VIP can capture the attacker safely (good trade?), do it. Otherwise, slide the VIP sideways off the line, or drop a pawn to block. Counterattack their pinner next turn.

- Against X-Ray Attacks: Warning signs: Enemy rook/queen/bishop behind a pawn wall on your file/diagonal, "peeking" at your pieces beyond. Pawn trades opening views? When it lands: Move your targeted piece out fast. Trade pawns to close the file. Can't block your own pieces, so push forward to mess their line.

- Against Discovered Attacks: Warning signs: Enemy pieces lined up (battery) like queen behind knight, and they move the front one your way. Surprise check coming! When it hits (often check): Block the new attack line with a pawn or piece. King-run to safety. Capture the revealer if possible—don't let them reload!

- Against Corridors (File Control): Warning signs: Enemy doubling rooks on a file after pawn trades, rolling toward your back rank. Center files (e/f) or wings (b/i) heating up? When invaded: Trade one of their rooks for yours to simplify. Counter-push pawns on that file or another to fight back. Use knights/trebuchets to jump and harass their rooks.

General Defense Tips: Castle early for king safety. Build thick pawn chains in center (d4-e4-f4). Keep pieces guarded (no loners). Trebuchets defend edges by jumping threats. If piece count low, stall for 10-move rule win. Spot setups on opponent's turn—say "Watch that knight!" to practice.

Your Move Checklist: Think Before You Click!
New players win more by thinking quick. Before EVERY move, run this super-simple checklist in your head (takes 10 seconds!):

1. Does this move put MY king in check? (Can opponent capture it next?) If yes, NOPE—undo!

2. After my move, is their king in check? (Yay! Say "Check!" Bonus if it's checkmate.)

3. Am I leaving ANY of my pieces exposed? (Hanging—like undefended and easy to capture for free or cheap trade?)

4. Does my opponent have hanging pieces I can capture safely? (Free lunch? Take it if it doesn't hurt me.)

5. Does this develop my pieces? (Knights/bishops/queen/trebuchets out? Pawns opening lines? Don't move same piece over and over.)

6. Am I controlling the center? (d5-g5 spots—fight for them on the big board!)

7. Any pawn promotions coming? (Push those passers!) Or closing in on 10-move rule?

If it passes, GO FOR IT! You'll blunder less and crush games soon.

Metric Chess Notation: Writing Down Your Awesome Moves!
Want to record games, share cool plays, or study like pros? Use "algebraic notation"—super easy! Write moves on paper like a story.

- Squares: Like we said, e4 or j10.
- Pawns: No letter, just start to end square (e2e4).
- Other pieces: Letter + square (Ne4 for knight to e4, Te6 for trebuchet).
- Captures: x (Nxe5 = knight captures on e5).
- Check: + (Qh5+).
- Checkmate: # (Qh7#).
- Castling: O-O (kingside), O-O-O (queenside).
- Promotion: = (e10=Q for pawn to queen).

If two pieces can go same spot? Add file or rank (Nce4 if c-knight or e-knight could go). Full game: 1. e2e4 e7e5 2. Nc3 ...

Example: White pawn two forward: e2e4. Black knight out: Nc6. White queen attacks: Qh5+.

Write both players' moves per line (1. white... black...). Replay anytime!

There you go—that's everything you need to start playing AND winning at Metric Chess. Grab a board, set it up, try a game, and use the checklist + combos. You'll be a pro in no time! If you have questions or want example positions, ask away. Have a blast!

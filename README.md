# Metric Chess

Welcome to **Metric Chess**—the coolest, biggest upgrade to chess ever! Imagine you're a super king leading a huge army of soldiers, catapults, and sneaky princes on a giant numbered playground. You and a friend take turns moving your pieces to trap the enemy's last king so bad he can't escape—that's a win! White always goes first to keep it fair. If things get stuck or nobody can win, it's a tie called a draw. Don't worry if you've never played anything like chess—I'll explain **every single thing** super easy, like we're playing right now with snacks. Lots of pictures in words, fun examples, and tips to beat your friends. Let's get started!

## What Is Metric Chess All About?

It's for two players: one with white pieces (you at the bottom), one with black (at the top). You swap turns moving **one piece** each time on a huge square playground. The big goal? Sneakily attack and capture your enemy's **last king** (they might have extra "heir kings" from promoted pawns—more on that awesome twist later). Put their last king in danger where he can't run, grab the attacker, or block? **Checkmate—you're the champion!**

Games end if someone says "I quit!" (resign), you both agree "Tie!", or special rules kick in (like no fights for 10 turns). No timers—we're chilling for fun. Touch pieces all you want, no rules broken. Games can last longer 'cause the board's bigger, but that's more epic battles!

## The Playground: The Board

Think of a giant checkerboard: **10 squares wide by 10 tall = 100 squares total**! Super metric (all 10s). Columns are **files numbered 0 to 9** (0 on left/queenside from white's view, 9 on right/kingside). Rows are **ranks 1 to 10** (1 at white's bottom, 10 at black's top). Name spots like **45** (file 4, rank 5).  
Put the board so white's at bottom. Squares alternate light/dark (fun to see moves). Set it with your **queen on her color** (white queen on light square at 41—make file0 rank1 dark if needed).

White chills on ranks 1-2, black on 9-10. No magic zones except promo lines.

## Your Army: Meet the Gang

You each start with **20 pieces** (10 big ones on back row + 10 pawns upfront). Each has cool powers! Capturing = jump on enemy square, kick 'em off forever. Can't grab your own team. Most go any direction; pawns only forward.

- **King (k/K)**: Your VIP boss with a cross hat! Moves **just 1 square** any way: up, down, left, right, or corner-diagonal. Can't go where danger waits (attacked square).
  Example: Your k at 51 can go 41 (left), 61 (right), 52 (up), 50 (down—nope, off board!), 42/62 (diags). Short and safe—like tip-toeing!

- **Queen (q/Q)**: The powerhouse boss lady! Zooms **any number of squares** straight: up/down/left/right **or diagonal**. Stops at blocks or captures enemy.
  Example: q at 45 (clear path) zips to 40 (down full file) or 05 (left across rank) or 88 (diag up-right). Enemy at 33? Capture to 33!

- **Rooks (r/R)**: Two castle towers! Any distance **up/down/left/right only** (no diags). No jumping blocks.
  Example: r at 11 slides to 110 (up full file) or 19 (right across rank 1).

- **Bishops (b/B)**: Two pointy-hat wizards! Any distance **diagonal only**. Stuck on same color squares forever. No jumps.
  Example: b at 31 goes 42, 53, 64, 75... up to 910! Backward too if clear.

- **Knights (n/N)**: Two horse buddies! Weird L-jump: **2 one way + 1 sideways** (or 1+2). **Jumps over everything**—sneaky!
  Example: n at 21 jumps to 03 (2 left 1 up), 12 (1 left 2 up), 32 (1 right 2 up), 40 (2 right 1 up). Can't go off!

- **Trebuchets (t/T)**: Your new favorite—**two catapults per side**! Medieval boulder-lobbers. Jump **exactly distance 3** (Chebyshev: biggest change in file or rank = exactly 3). Up to **24 spots** in center—like a huge ring around! Skips close squares (no 1-2 away). **Super strong (beats rook)** but get 'em out early—they can't fight neighbors!
  Example: t at 44 blasts to 14 (3 down), 74 (3 up), 01 (3 left 3 down—off? Trim!), 13 (3 left 1 down), **24 spots total central**. From corner t00: 7 spots like 03/12/21/30. Jumps anything!

- **Pawns (p/P)**: **10 little soldiers** upfront! Forward only (white up to rank 10, black down to 1). **Always 1 or 2 squares** if empty ahead—no jumping back. Capture **1 diagonal forward**.
  Example: White p at 24 goes p35 or p46 (clear). Enemy at 35? Capture there! Straight block? Stuck.

## Setting Up the Game

Board ready? White bottom.  
**White Rank 1 (back row)**: t0 r1 n2 b3 **q4 k5** b6 n7 r8 t9.  
**Rank 2**: p0 p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 p6 p7 p8 p9.  
**Black Rank 10**: T0 R1 N2 B3 **Q4 K5** B6 N7 R8 T9.  
**Rank 9**: P0 to P9.  
Queens stare on file 4, kings file 5. Perfect!

## How to Play: Moving and Grabbing Enemies

Your turn: Pick **one piece**, slide/jump to legal spot. Capture optional (land on enemy). No through friends (jumpers ok). Off board? Nope!  
**Danger Zone (Check!)**: If your move attacks their **last king**, yell "Check!" They fix it: Move that king safe, grab your attacker, or block (sliders only).  
Example: Your q at 45 eyes black's last K at 50 (clear file 5)—"Check!" Black: K to 51, or pawn blocks 47.

## Special Moves: Cool Tricks

- **Rook Castling**: King hides safe with rook buddy (once per side).  
  **Kingside (right)**: k51 → 71, r81 → 61 (61/71 empty, no danger).  
  **Queenside (left)**: k51 → 21, r11 → 31 (21/31/41 empty).  
  One turn! King/rook unmoved before.

- **Trebuchet Castling**: Flank fort bomb! King dashes **3 squares** (once/side).  
  **Kingside**: k51 → 81, t91 → 61 (61/71/81 empty).  
  **Queenside**: k51 → 01, t01 → 31 (01/11/21/31 empty).  
  Same rules—epic catapult cover!

- **Pawn Promotion**: Pawn hits enemy back (white rank10, black rank1) → pick **q/r/b/n/t/k**! Boom—instant upgrade.
  Example: p99 to 910 = q! (Even capturing.)

- **Heir Kings**: Promo to **k** = heir prince! Moves like king (1 any).  
  **Super Sneaky**: Not "royal" till your **last king**—treat like normal piece (can capture it)! Check **only** on last king.  
  **Kings Repel**: No king (heir/original) can move/end next to **any** king (own/enemy)—illegal!  
  Heirs can't castle (already "moved" via promo).  
  Theme: Pawn was secret heir—fights for dad! If heir stuck? Move something else (no stalemate).

## How Games End: Win Big or Tie

- **Checkmate**: Their last king checked, no fix—you win!  
  Example: Last K09 trapped by your r05 (file0 attack), no escape—victory dance!
- **Stalemate**: Your turn, no moves, **their last king safe** = tie. (Heir stuck? Other moves ok.)
- **3x Repeat**: Same setup 3 times (your turn) = tie claim.
- **10-Move Rule**: 10 full turns (20 moves) no captures? Count pieces—**fewer wins**! Equal = tie. (Huge army vs lone k? You lose—smart defense!)
- **No Mate Possible**: Just kings = tie.
- Resign ("I lose!") or agree tie.

## Tips for Super Fun

Push pawns to free friends, get ts/knights out quick, watch your last king. Mistakes? Giggle and learn! Bigger board = more room to zoom.

## Strategy Guide: Be a Metric Master

Tricks to crush! Start solo pieces, then team-ups. 10x10 = wing raids + center wars.

### Piece-by-Piece Tips

- **k**: Castle early (T-castle flank forts!). Late: Sneak center 45 to guard heirs.
- **q**: Center 44-55 rules everything—protect her!
- **r**: Claim open files (1/8 starts)—double on rank9 gobble pawns.
- **b**: Super-long diags (09-90!).
- **n**: Holes like 36/46—fork city!
- **t**: **Early leaps**! 24-ring central = fork monster. Wings snipe, pair for bomb rings. Can't fight close—pawn shield!
- **p**: Center files 2-6 push 2 squares—race heirs! Passed p (alone file) = promo gold.

### Team-Up Powers (Superhero Combos!)

- **Forks**: One piece hits 2+! t/n kings—t44 eyes 24!
  Setup: Jump central. Ex: t44 forks Q67 + R53.
- **Pins**: Trap foe—can't move or VIP exposed behind. q/r/b best.
  Setup: Line slider through enemy to their king/q. Ex: r05 pins n57 (K50 behind).
- **Skewers**: VIP front, weak behind—hit VIP, it flees, grab weak.
  Setup: Open file. Ex: q22 skewers R85 (heir k90 behind).
- **X-Rays**: Attack "through" pieces (your pawns ok).
  Setup: r behind p-wall. Ex: r23 through p45 hits enemy 78.
- **Discovered Attacks**: Move front piece, reveal back attack!
  Setup: Battery q behind b. Ex: b44 away → q attacks k!
- **Corridors**: Own file with double r—invade back rank.
  Setup: Trade p on file4, roll rs.

**Metric Bonus**: 0-9 wings for t raids; center 3-6 files battleground. Heirs distract!

### Defensive Strategies: Spot Danger & Block It

Half the game—be a shield boss! Checklist spots setups; here's how to smash.

- **Vs Forks**: Warning: Enemy t/n jumping center (44?). Eyes 2 yours? Save VIP (q first), capture unprotected forker, move to attack it.
- **Vs Pins**: Warning: Slider lining file/diag to your VIP. Sac cheap piece, capture pinner (safe?), pawn block line.
- **Vs Skewers**: Warning: Slider on open file to your strong piece (junk behind). VIP capture attacker? Slide off line, block.
- **Vs X-Rays**: Warning: Enemy slider peeking through pawns. Move target, close file with trade.
- **Vs Discovered**: Warning: Enemy battery (q behind n), front moving. Block new line, king run, capture revealer.
- **Vs Corridors**: Warning: Enemy rs doubling file post-p-trade. Trade rs, counter-push p, t/n harass.
- **Vs Heirs/t**: Pawn chains cover rings/heir adjacents. Stall 10-move if low pieces (fewer wins!).
- **General**: Castle ASAP, thick p-center (34-45), guard loners, spot on their turn—"Watch that t!"

## Your Move Checklist: Win Every Time

Before moving:

1. Puts **my last k** in check? Nope!
2. Checks **their last k**? "Check!" (Mate?)
3. Leaves **my pieces hanging** (free grab)?
4. **Their hanging pieces** I can snag safe?
5. **Develops** (t/n/q out, p opens)?
6. Grabs **center** (44-55)?
7. Promos/10-move closing?

Pass? Boom—move!

## Metric Notation: Number Magic

Write moves like codes—super short!

- Light pieces use lowercase, Dark pieces use uppercase
- Pawn: **P45** (to 45) or **P24** (from rank2 file4).
- Piece: **T45**, **n36**.
- Capture: **txT** (t takes T). Ambiguous? **t05xT36**.
- Check: **+** (**q45+**). Mate: **#**.
- Castling: **O-O** (r kingside), **O-O-O** (r queenside), **O-O-O-O** (t kingside), **O-O-O-O-O** (t queenside).

That's **all of Metric Chess**—heirs, mega-ts, 10s everywhere! Set up, play a game, use checklist. You'll rule!

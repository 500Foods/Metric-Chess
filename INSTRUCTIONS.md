# Metric Chess - Developer Guide

## 📋 Overview

**Metric Chess** is a 10x10 chess variant featuring trebuchets, heir kings, and advanced AI powered by Fairy-Stockfish. This guide provides high-level information for developers working on the project.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

- **Game Logic** (`js/chess.js`): Chess rules, move validation, game state
- **Rendering** (`js/render.js`): Board display, piece positioning, animations
- **Application** (`js/main.js`): User interaction, event handling, game flow
- **AI Engine** (`js/stockfish/`): Multi-threaded chess analysis using WebAssembly

### Key Features

- **10x10 Board**: Extended battlefield with unique trebuchet pieces
- **Multi-threading AI**: Non-blocking analysis using web workers and WASM
- **Progressive Web App**: Offline functionality and native app experience
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Customizable UI**: Font Awesome icon system with Pro kit support

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
